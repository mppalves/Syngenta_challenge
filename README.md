## Description:
Today, the agriculture industry works to maximize the amount of food we gain from crops by breeding plants with the strongest, highest-yielding genetics. Scientists at research and development organizations like Syngenta create more resilient plants by breeding and then selecting the best offspring, over time, to provide to farmers.

We’ve proven that data-driven strategies can help our industry breed better seeds that require fewer resources and are adaptable to more diverse environments. Developing models that identify robust patterns in our experimental data may help scientists more accurately choose seeds that increase the productivity of the crops we plant – and will help address the growing global food demand.
